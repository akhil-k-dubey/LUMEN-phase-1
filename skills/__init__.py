"""
skills — Built-in skill engine for LUMEN.

Every skill is a callable that returns a string result.
The LLM triggers skills by emitting [ACTION:skill_name:args] in its response.
The main loop intercepts these, runs the skill, and feeds the result back.

All tools are FREE FOREVER — no API keys required.

This package re-exports everything that was previously in the monolithic skills.py
for full backward compatibility.
